- 👋 Hi, I’m @jrvasquez3
- 👀 I’m interested in optimization and operations research...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on operations research, and other fun engineering problems...
- 📫 How to reach me ...



- Currently trying to move some of my work from Bitbucket to github as my platform of choice has been Bitbucket.

- Unfortunately, all of my previous works were produced for an employer so I do not have much to show
- hence why I am starting to work on some 'open source' projects to showcast my abilities and perphaps help some people




In the meantime, below are some works I have done for classes during university
